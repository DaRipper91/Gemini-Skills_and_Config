# Document Creation

This folder collects resources for writing documentation with the Gemini CLI. Start with `DOCUMENTATION_TOOLS_GUIDE.md`, which outlines recommended extensions, prompts, and workflows for generating READMEs, manuals, and technical guides.

Use these materials to standardize how you create and polish project documentation across repositories.
