# Gemini Skills and Config

This repository organizes Gemini CLI extensions, skills, and local configuration used to automate research, coding assistance, and documentation workflows. Use this repo as a reference or starting point for enabling these capabilities in your own environment.

## Repository layout

- **Document Creation/** – Guidance for producing documentation with Gemini. See the folder README for details.
- **config/** – Local Gemini CLI settings and memories.
- **extensions/** – Individual Gemini extensions available for enablement.
